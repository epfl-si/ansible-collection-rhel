    changes:
      known_issues:
      - ohmyzsh - All previous version had a issue that may prevent you to update
        the custom plugins using GIT. To see if you are impacted, simply do a git
        status inside ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins. If git list alot of files changed,
        then you have to bug. To fix it, you have 2 options. 1) Delete the ~/.oh-my-zsh
        folder and run this role again. 2) Use the command `git reset --hard HEAD`
        in each impacted git repo.
      minor_changes:
      - ohmyzsh - Change installation method from bundle to git clone
      release_summary: The ohmyzsh roles was causing issue because we were changing
        file permission. This prevented oh-my-zsh to update itself due to all files
        been makes 'unstaged' by git. During the release of a newer version of the
        role, Ansible Galaxy refused our new version due to a file, the bundle installer
        of oh-my-zsh + its plugins, been too big (23MB). The I had now other choice
        to revert the installation to git clone. The role may become very slow to
        deploy for the first time. But now 'omz update' should works properly.
