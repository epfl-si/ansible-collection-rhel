release_summary: >
  Many roles have been refactored to be simpler to use. With less relying on
  the inventory it's now easier to understand what a role will do. Before that
  you had to look the playbook, see there is an inclusion of a role, then search
  in the inventory for the corresponding variables.

removed_features:

  - "users_linux - This role is deleted. Use epfl_si.rhel.user, \
    epfl_si.rhel.ohmyzsh and epfl_si.rhel.sudo instead"

major_changes:

  - user - New role that creates a linux user and manage $PATH for bash and zsh
  - sudo - New role that manages sudoers.d drop-in files
  - ohmyzsh - New role with a pre-build .oh-my-zsh for a fast installation
