minor_changes:

  - ohmyzsh - Change installation method from bundle to git clone

known_issues:

  - ohmyzsh - All previous version had a issue that may prevent you to update
    the custom plugins using GIT. To see if you are impacted, simply do a git
    status inside ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins. If git list alot of files
    changed, then you have to bug. To fix it, you have 2 options. 1) Delete
    the ~/.oh-my-zsh folder and run this role again. 2) Use the command
    `git reset --hard HEAD` in each impacted git repo.

release_summary: The ohmyzsh roles was causing issue because we were changing
  file permission. This prevented oh-my-zsh to update itself due to all files
  been makes 'unstaged' by git. During the release of a newer version of the
  role, Ansible Galaxy refused our new version due to a file, the bundle
  installer of oh-my-zsh + its plugins, been too big (23MB). The I had now
  other choice to revert the installation to git clone. The role may become
  very slow to deploy for the first time. But now 'omz update' should works
  properly.
