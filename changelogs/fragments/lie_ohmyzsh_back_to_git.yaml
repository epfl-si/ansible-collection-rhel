  - ohmyzsh - Change installation method from bundle to git clone

release_summary: The ohmyzsh roles was causing issue because we were changing
  file permission. This prevented oh-my-zsh to update itself due to all files
  been makes 'unstaged' by git. During the release of a newer version of the
  role, Ansible Galaxy refused our new version due to a file, the bundle
  installer of oh-my-zsh + its plugins, been too big (23MB). The I had now
  other choice to revert the installation to git clone. The role may become
  very slow to deploy for the first time. But now 'omz update' should works
  properly.
