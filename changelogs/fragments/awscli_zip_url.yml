- "awscli - Added new option 'awscli_version' with a default value of 2.27.49.
  This changes the previous behavior where the role always downloaded the
  latest version."
- "awscli - Added new option 'awscli_binary_url' that allows specifying a
  custom URL for the zip file. This is useful when using a mirror or private
  repository."
