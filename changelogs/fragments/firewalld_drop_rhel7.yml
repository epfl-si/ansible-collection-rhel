release_summary: |
  This release drops support for RHEL7 in the firewalld role. This moves was
  decided because the molecule tests stop working on our RHEL8 VM that runs
  Podman. We prioritize moving to RHEL8 instead of spending time creating
  automated tests for an old version.

  Unless someone step in to help, There is strong chances that all roles
  will soon drop support for RHEL7.
