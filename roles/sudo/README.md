Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```yaml
- hosts: servers
  roles:
    - role: epfl_si.rhel.sudo
      sudoers_file: 20-my-user
      rules:
        - user: my_user
          commands: ['cmd1', 'cmd2']
          nopasswd: true
```
