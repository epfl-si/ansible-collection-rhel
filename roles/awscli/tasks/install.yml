# Amazon provides a GPG key signature to test the validity of the bundle but
# get_url doesn't support that kind of checks (Ansible 4.1.0 at time of
# writing this) so we take a leap of faith for now and don't check the file.
# Also we could specify which version to download. For simplicity we will
# always download the latest available for now.
